# 3.3 Alternating Caps 

[Alternating capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_caps) is a form of text notation in which the capitalization of letters varies by some pattern, or arbitrarily (often also omitting spaces between words and occasionally some letters), such as "aLtErNaTiNg cApS".

In `main.py`, make a function that converts any string to alternating caps.

For an extra challenge you could try giving the function another parameter where you can vary the pattern of capital and lowercase letters (e.g. 3 lowercase and then a capital)
